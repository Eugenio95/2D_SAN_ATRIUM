# 2D_SAN_ATRIUM
Discrete model implementation with GPU parallelization of a bi-dimensional human model of sinoatrial node-atrial interaction including heterogeneity and fibrosis.

Scripts to design and analyze the simulations are provided, as well as four different versions of the model to simulate 1) free pacemaking activity and 2) high frequency pacing protocol with both the Koivumaki et al. 2011 and Mazhar-Bartolucci-Severi 2023 atrial models. 

From Ricci et al.
